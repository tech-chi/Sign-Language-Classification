# Sign Language Classification

This project uses a neural network model to classify hand-written American Sign Language (ASL) digits (0-9). The dataset is based on pixel values of images, and the model is built using the `scikit-learn` library.

## Files
- `sign_language_classification.py`: The Python script that implements the neural network and evaluates its performance.
- `sign_mnist_13bal_train.csv`: The training dataset.
- `sign_mnist_13bal_test.csv`: The test dataset.

## Installation
You can clone this repository and run the Python script by installing the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
